# Breakthrough-Graphic-Interface

Graphic interface for the game Breakthrough developed in PROLOG by [Pedro Castro](https://github.com/F0lha). The communication between languages was achieved through sockets. The graphic interface is a WebGL based software using JavaScript and xml for scene definition and rendering. 

## Rules of the Game

A player has a golden fleet which includes the red ship and twelve guards. The objective of this player is to avoid capture whilst he/she conducts the red ship towards the end of the board. The other player has a silver fleet of 20 ships and his/her objective is to capture the red ship.
Each player can move a piece on the horizontal or vertical direction. Each move has a cost depending on the executed movement. For example, moving the red ship has the maximum cost which is 2. At the start of the game, each player has 2 move points as well as 1 capture point to spend. A simple movement has the cost of 1.

## Interface

The interface allows costumization of some game options listed below.

+ UNDO
  - to undo de move
+ THEME
  - to chose the theme
+ LEVEL
  - two difficulties are available (hard and random)
+ GAME MODE
  - there are 3 game modes (HumanvsHuman/HumanvsBot/BotvsBot)
+ ON/OFF
  - play with the lights

## Getting Started

In order to have the system running on your local machine for development and testing purposes see the notes below.

### Prerequisites

To run the simulation you must have the following software:

+ [SICStus Prolog](https://sicstus.sics.se/) (take into consideration that this software needs a license) - to run the game's logic in prolog
+ [Mongoose](https://www.cesanta.com/) - web server to connect

### Installing

To get the game up and running follow these steps:

```
1. Open SICStus console
2. Go to File->Consult
3. Navigate to the folder reader\prolog and select the file server.pl
